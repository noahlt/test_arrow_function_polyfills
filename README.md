TL;DR: according to the spec, arrow functions don't get an `arguments` object.  Instead, use rest parameters.

This small package demonstrates the difference between the fat-arrow functions as polyfilled by the deprecated `react-tools` package and `babel`.  Start by running `npm install` to get the required packages.

Here's our code to be transformed, in `code.js`:

```
var f = () => {
	console.log(arguments);
}
```

Run `npm run react-tools` to see the output generated by `react-tools`:

```
var f = function()  {
	console.log(arguments);
}
```

As you can see, this preserves the `arguments` object.

Run `npm run babel` to see the output generated by `babel`:

```
"use strict";

var _arguments = arguments;
var f = function f() {
	console.log(_arguments);
};
```

As you can see, `babel` adds a transformation to use the `arguments` object from the enclosing scope.

It turns out `babel` is in line with the spec here.  From the Mozilla documentation:

> Arrow functions do not expose an arguments object to their code: arguments.length, arguments[0], arguments[1], and so forth do not refer to the arguments provided to the arrow function when called.  Instead, arguments is simply a reference to the name in the enclosing scope.
>
> Arrow functions don't have their own arguments object, but in most cases rest parameters are a good alternative:
